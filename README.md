# 💬 Chatbot using Streamlit and OpenAI GPT-3.5

This repository contains a simple chatbot application built using Streamlit and OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model. The chatbot allows users to input messages and receive responses generated by GPT-3.5. It serves as a demonstration of how to integrate OpenAI's API with Streamlit to create an interactive web-based conversational application.

## ✨ Features

- User-friendly chatbot interface built with Streamlit.
- Uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model to generate conversational responses.
- API key integration for secure and customizable use.
- Supports persistent chat history during a session.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before running this application, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- An OpenAI API key (get it [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys))

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatbot-streamlit.git
cd chatbot-streamlit
```

### 2. Set Up the Environment

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up Your OpenAI API Key

You can provide your OpenAI API key securely in one of the following ways:

- **Option 1**: Create a `.env` file in the project root and add the following line:

  ```env
  OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
  ```

- **Option 2**: Use Streamlit secrets management by adding your API key to the `secrets.toml` file:

  ```toml
  [default]
  OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-api-key-here"
  ```

- **Option 3**: Input the API key directly into the app when prompted (not recommended for production).

### 5. Run the Application

Start the Streamlit app with the following command:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

Open your browser and navigate to the URL provided (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

## 🛠️ Usage

1. Enter your OpenAI API key if prompted.
2. Type your message in the input field.
3. Receive responses generated by GPT-3.5.
4. Continue the conversation or restart the session as needed.
