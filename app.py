            Key Components:

            NLP and Logistic Regression:

            1.The chatbot uses NLP techniques to analyze user input and categorize it into predefined intents, such as asking about specific medications or seeking general information.
            Logistic Regression is employed to classify and map user input to the appropriate intent and response.
            Streamlit Interface:

            2.Streamlit is used to create an interactive and user-friendly interface where users can type their questions and receive responses from the chatbot.
            The chatbot provides an interface where users can interact with it by entering text, and it responds with information based on the intent and entities extracted.

        Patterns: ["Hi", "Hello", "Hey", "How are you"]

        About:
